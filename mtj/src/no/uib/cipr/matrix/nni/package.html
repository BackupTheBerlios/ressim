Native numerical interface to <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas">BLAS</a> and
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack">LAPACK</a>. It is seldom necessary
to call methods in this package directly, instead, use the high-level
routines in the main matrix package.
<p>
Furthermore, these classes will only be useable if the corresponding native
libraries have been built. Without the native libraries, the matrix package
uses <a href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/f2j/">JLAPACK</a> instead.
