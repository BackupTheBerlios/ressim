\chapter{PVT calculations}
\label{chapter:pvt}

To verify the fluid properties, the simulator includes an auxiliary
PVT calculations application. Given pressure, temperature and overall
masses, it performs phase state and equilibrium calculations to
determine the split composition, and may optionally print and verify
phase composition/volume derivatives.

The input file is named \texttt{pvt}, and it looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
pressure    2e+7 % Pressure in Pascal
temperature 450  % Temperature in Kelvin

% Number of moles of each component. Missing entries are defaulted to zero
H2O 1e+11
C1  2e+10
C4  1e+10

Verify yes  % True to verify derivatives calculations. Default: no
Delta  1e-6 % For determining numerical derivatives. Default: 1e-5

begin Components
  % The different chemical species
  ...
end

begin EquationOfState
  % The equation of state to use
  ...
end
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{Components} and \texttt{EquationOfState} sections are
identical to the fluid data the simulator uses.
