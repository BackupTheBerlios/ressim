#!./triangle -pq simple.poly
# Vertices. First comes the number of points that follow, then
# comes the dimension for each point. We have 0 attributes
# that we would like to pass on to the output. We don't have to
# name the boundary points in the input file (triangle will 
# identify them for us in the output).
# For each data point comes first the index of the number, which
# is here a running counter from one and up, and then the coordinates.

# Edges. First is the number of edges, then a flag that determines
# whether we have boundaries or not (we don't).
# For each data point there is first the index of the edge (one-based)
# and then the indices into the array above of the two end-points.
# The last four points are the boundaries of the box in this example.
