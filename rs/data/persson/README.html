<h1>Fracture Triangulation</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The package assumes to be placed in a directory two levels down from
the root, e.g. in <code>$RS/misc/persson</code>. The utility programs
should be placed in <code>$RS/lib</code> relative to this. It is
written in Matlab 7, service pack 3.
</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>
Entry point of the program is the main command. It takes a list of
arguments which is treated in pairs as name and value of tunable
options. The return value of a run is the statistics for the mesh 
that is generated.
</p>
<dl>
<p>
<dt>stats = main (key1, val1, key2, val2, ...)</dt>
<dd>
Runs the program with key1 and key2 as parameters, having values val1
and val2 respectively, and put the statistics in the structure named stats.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>display_statistics (stats)</dt>
<dd>
Write a brief summary of the statistics in the structure stats to the console.
</dd>
</p>
</dl>

<p>
The program may be called from a shell wrapper
called <code>persson.sh</code>. When run in this manner, it accepts
the same parameters as the main program but they must be specified in
"GNU" style (see the example section).
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each quality measure the mean of the sample, the standard
deviation and the tenth percentile is given. (The percentile is chosen
instead of the minimum value because there is bound to be at least
some element that is notoriously bad in a large sample, but it does
not necessarily say something about the overall quality).
</p>

<dl>
<p>
<dt>Angle quality</dt>
<dd>
The angle quality is the ratio between the smallest circle that could
enclose the triangle and the largest circle that could fit inside it,
adjusted so that a triangle with all equal sides give a quality of 1.0. 
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Size quality</dt>
<dd>
The size quality is the ratio between the squared mean and the squared
deviance from the mean, adjusted so that an element that is exactly
the size of the mean has a quality of 1.0, and an element that is
infinitely smaller or larger has a quality of 0.0.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Time benchmark</dt>
<dd>
Three phases are timed: building a background mesh and introducing the
fractures into it, running the Triangle program, and adjusting the
vertices for refinement.
</dd>
</p>
</dl>

<h2>Files</h2>
<dl>
<p>
<dt>*.orig</dt>
<dd>
Template input files to the fracture generator. A new set of inputs
based on these files in conjunction with the parameters will be
written (and subsequently deleted). Keep these files in your source
repository together with the program files.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>mesh*.poly</dt>
<dt>mesh*.ele</dt>
<dt>mesh*.node</dt>
<dd>
Output files from the last triangulation performed. These files can be
used as input files to the mesh generator.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>*.csv</dt>
<dd>
Data files on comma-separated value format. The first row
of the file contains the names of each column, with each column
separated by commas. Each subsequent row of the file contains the same
number of columns and represents one tuple entry.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>*.m</dt>
<dd>
Program files.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>*.sh</dt>
<dd>
Shell wrapper.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>*.xsl</dt>
<dd>
Stylesheets used to extract information about deterministic fractures
from specified files.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>*.odp</dt>
<dt>*.sxi</dt>
<dt>*.svg</dt>
<dd>
Example files for deterministic fractures, in OpenOffice 1.1/2.0
Presentation or Scalable Vector Graphics format.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>fig*.png</dt>
<dd>
Saved images of the triangulation as the algorithm progresses.
</dd>
</p>
</dl>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<dl>
<p>
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>
Run program in batch mode. The file referred to by this value will be
read, and the program will be run for each entry in the file, using
the columns as named parameters for that run. If you specify the input 
parameter, you must also specify the output parameter. Other
parameters may also be specified as arguments to the program and these
will be used in addition to those read from the file.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd>
When running in batch mode, results are not returned in a variable but
rather written to file using the same format as the input files. In
addition to the statistics for the case, the input data that was used
to generated it is also written. Thus, the output file may also be
used as an input file for the next iteration.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>active</dt>
<dd>
If this flag is zero, then the case will be skipped as if its line
wasn't there in the file. Use this to avoid cutting and pasting lines
in the input file to change cases. Only available in batch mode.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>aperture</dt>
<dd>
Interactive design programs may or may not coalesce close vertices
into the same point. This parameter determines the relative width of
the grid to which points should be snapped. Set this value to zero if
you want to keep the input points exactly where they were put in the
input file.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>art</dt>
<dd>
Generate output that is compatible with that which is written by the
ART (Almost Regular Triangulation) program. The resulting file can
then be used by the MUFTE-UG simulator.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>bnd</dt>
<dd>
Also generate a boundary file (with the extension .bnd) in addition to
ART-compatible networks (.net). Only available if the setting "art" is
also enabled.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>persson</dt>
<dd>
Use Persson's algorithm for triangle refinement. The area is initially
populated with equilateral triangles and then the fractures are
introduced. Vertices close to the fractures are removed and the rest
is moved to an equilibrium.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>smoothing</dt>
<dd>
Scheme to use when smoothing particle location throughout the mesh.
Specify <code>truss</code> to use the truncated error potential used
in the article by Persson and Strang, or <code>bossen</code> to use
the modified Lennard-Jones molecular potential by Frank Bossen. The
default is the latter.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>fractures</dt>
<dd>
If specified, this parameter contains the name of a file from which
the fractures should be read instead of generating a stochastic
network. The format of the file is determined by the extension of the
filename. Currently supported formats are: OpenOffice 1.1 Presentations
(*.sxi), OpenOffice 2.0 Presentations (*.odp) and Scalable Vector Graphics
(*.svg).
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>steiner</dt>
<dd>
Allow the Triangle program to introduce extra vertices in the area to
refine the mesh. This option should only be used if you are not using
Persson's algorithm.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>refine</dt>
<dd>
Levels of refinement that is desirable. The number specified is the
number of iterations that will be run through the Triangle program. If
you are using Persson's algorithm, leave this at one. This number is
also specified in the Triangle mesh description in order for the
simulator to know which files to import.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>minangle</dt>
<dd>
Minimum angle that is allowed in a triangle; elements with steeper
angles between sides than this will be refined. The algorithm is
guaranteed to produce a result with a minimum angle as high as 28.6 degrees.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>maxarea</dt>
<dd>
Maximum area that is allowed in a triangle; elements that are larger
than this will be refined. The value is a measure relative to the
ideal size given the desired number of elements in the problem.
Unfortunately, there is no option to specify the minimum area allowed, 
which means that a lot of small triangles may be generated when using 
refinement.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>minarea</dt>
<dd>
If specified, this option will inhibit refinement of any triangles
smaller than the specified size (relative to the ideal size of an
element). You may still get smaller triangles however, since the 
fractures may make it impossible to fit triangles into the mesh otherwise.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>retriangulate</dt>
<dd>
Relative movement (to ideal length) necessary for retriangulation to
occur after some vertices have been moved. This parameter is called
ttol in Persson's article. Set it to inf to prevent retriangulation
from ever occurring.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>proximity</dt>
<dd>
Distance from the fractures that spans out a zone in which all
vertices are removed. This is done to prevent congestion around the
fractures (the triangles will be anchored to the fractures as well as
the vertices around). The value is relative to the ideal length
calculated.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>border</dt>
<dd>
If this flag is set, keep extra interior points near the border even
if they are close to the edges. This may be necessary if the fracture
network has lines that are parallel and very close to the border.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>scale</dt>
<dd>
Factor with which the ideal length will be multiplied before comparing
the current length to it to find out if the vertex wants to repulse
any of its neighbors. If this value is greater than 1.0, then the
truss will act as if it has stronger springs.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>timestep</dt>
<dd>
Portion of the force between vertices that are applied before
reevaluating the positions. The smaller this value is, the slower the
algorithm works, the larger it is, the more divergent it becomes.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>maxiter</dt>
<dd>
Maximum number of iterations. Only applicable when running Persson's algorithm.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>tolerance</dt>
<dd>
When the largest movement inside the mesh (the boundary doesn't count
because their movement is limited) is smaller relative to the ideal
length than this value, the iteration stops and the mesh is considered
good enough.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>seed</dt>
<dd>
Seed between 0.0 and 1.0 that is used as an input to the random
fracture generation. If you use the same value for the seed, then the
same fractures will be generated. Alter this value to get variations
in the fracture pattern that is created.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>density</dt>
<dd>
Number of square meters of dimensionally-reduced fracture area that will
be generated per cube meter (i.e. fully-dimensioned) of volume. Use
this option to generate a more fractured area.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>elements</dt>
<dd>
Number of elements that is desired for the mesh. This number is only
advisory; more or less elements will be generated in practice.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>keep</dt>
<dd>
Flag that determines if the triangulation files will remain on disk
after the program has finished or if they'll be cleaned up. Set this
option to 1 to instruct the program to let the files remain so they
can be imported in the simulator mesh generator.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>visual</dt>
<dd>
Flag that determines whether a figure is shown for each iteration
through the triangulation, visualizing the movement or additions of vertices.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
Positive number that will be used to generate unique filenames for
each case (if you want to save the results for further processing).
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>save</dt>
<dd>
If set, visualizations will be saved to files matching a pattern
combining the case number and the iteration number, in addition to 
being shown. These files can then be used to create a movie/slideshow 
of the progress afterwards.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>color</dt>
<dd>
Color of the constraining fractures in a plot. Use a single letter to
indicate the color code. 'r' is for red, 'b' is for blue and 'k' is
for black.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>line</dt>
<dd>
Line thickness of the constraining fractures in a plot. Specify 2 to
visually distinguish these from the other edges.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>libdir</dt>
<dd>
Location of the helper programs Frac3D and Triangle. Use this option
if you want to move the programs out of the standard directory structure.
</dd>
</p>
</dl>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
If you want to run Persson's algorithm interactively, use this
command:
<blockquote><code><pre>
main ('persson', 1, 'visual', 1);
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To run first Persson's algorithm and then Triangle on the same case,
displaying only statistics, use these commands:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>
display_statistics (main ('fractures', 'myfile.odp', 'persson', 1));
display_statistics (main ('fractures', 'myfile.odp', 'persson', 0));
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
If you want to test the algorithm with two different timesteps, for
two different tolerances, you could write the
following <code>inp.csv</code> file:
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>
timestep, scale
0.1,      1.0
0.2,      1.0
0.1,      1.2
0.2,      1.2
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Then execute the program in batch:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>
main ('input', 'inp.csv', 'output', 'outp.csv');
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
You will now receive an output file containing statistics for the four
different cases, marked with the input data that was used to generate them.
</p>
<p>
A case may also be ran directly from the command-line. The wrapper
script will launch Matlab and run the correct command. You do not have
to run the script from the program directory; we recommend that you
run it from a directory containing the data files only.
<blockquote><code><pre>
./persson.sh --input=inp.csv --output=outp.csv --timestep=0.2
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
If you are running a bash shell, you can define the following alias to
run the program in the background using standard Unix job control:
<blockquote><code><pre>
persson() { /usr/bin/time -f "Seconds: %U" nice -n 5 ./persson.sh $@ 1>>nohup.out 2>&1 & disown -h %%; }
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
If you are unfortunate enough to use the C shell, you can attempt the 
following alias definition instead:
<blockquote><code><pre>
alias persson 'nohup /usr/bin/time -f "Seconds: %U" nice -n 5 ./persson.sh \!:* >>& nohup.out &'
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To generate thumbnails of the mesh that will be used for a simulation,
use the special option <code>mesh-only</code> to the simulation
wrapper and pass additional arguments to customize the figures like this:
<blockquote><code><pre>
./simulate.sh --input=cases.csv --mesh-only --save=1 --color=k --line=2
</pre></code></blockquote>
Note that all cases should have an identifier set.
